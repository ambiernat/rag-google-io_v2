# 📄 RAG Retrieval, Evaluation & Production Deployment

## Project Overview

This project implements a **production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** for Google I/O transcripts, supporting **dense, sparse, and hybrid retrieval**, **reranking**, **offline evaluation**, and a **deployed FastAPI service on AWS**.

It combines:

- Research-grade evaluation pipelines  
- Config-driven retrieval experimentation  
- A production-ready FastAPI API  
- Containerized cloud deployment using **AWS ECS + Fargate**

---

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### Retrieval

- **Dense retrieval** — SentenceTransformers embeddings  
- **Hybrid retrieval** — Dense + sparse fusion  
- **Vector store** — Qdrant  

### Reranking
- CrossEncoder-based reranking
- Hyperparameter optimization (HPO)
- Offline comparison of reranking strategies

### Agentic Retrieval
- Query rewriting — LLM-generated variants to broaden recall

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration is **YAML-driven** across ingestion, retrieval, and evaluation.

**Example (`retrieval/config.yaml`):**

```yaml
qdrant:
  url: "http://localhost:6333"

collections:
  dense: "google-io-transcripts-dense"
  sparse: "google-io-transcripts-sparse"
  hybrid: "google-io-transcripts-hybrid"

retrieval:
  top_k: 5
```

---

## ▶️ Running Locally

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Example API Call

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/search?query=large language models&top_k=5"
```

---

## 🧪 Offline Evaluation

### Run retrieval benchmarks locally:

```bash
python evaluation/evaluate_dense.py
python evaluation/evaluate_sparse.py
python evaluation/evaluate_hybrid.py
python evaluation/evaluate_rerank_post_hpo.py
python evaluation/evaluate_agentic.py
```

### Outputs are written to:

```text
data/eval/results/
```

## 📊 Evaluation Results

Evaluation was conducted in three stages, each progressively improving ground truth quality.

### Ground Truth Construction

Ground truth was generated using GPT (`gpt-4o-mini`) by sampling 2 chunks per video across 78 videos, yielding **312 queries**. Two improvements were applied iteratively:

1. **Paraphrasing** — queries were rewritten to reduce vocabulary overlap with source chunks, making evaluation more realistic and less favourable to BM25
2. **Multi-doc relevance labelling** — instead of a single relevant document per query, GPT-as-judge labelled all retrieved top-5 candidates as relevant/not relevant, giving graded rather than binary relevance

---

### Round 1 — Synthetic Ground Truth (Baseline)

Queries generated directly from source chunks. High vocabulary overlap artificially inflates BM25 performance.

| Method | Recall@5 | MRR | Precision@5 |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| Dense  | 0.801 | 0.637 | 0.160 |
| Hybrid | 0.990 | 0.814 | 0.198 |
| Sparse | 0.990 | 0.943 | 0.198 |

Sparse dominates on MRR because exact keyword matching aligns perfectly with synthetically generated queries. Results are optimistic and not representative of real user queries.

---

### Round 2 — Paraphrased Ground Truth

Queries rewritten to use different vocabulary, exposing retrieval robustness more fairly.

| Method | Recall@5 | MRR | Precision@5 |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| Dense  | 0.702 | 0.531 | 0.140 |
| Hybrid | 0.946 | 0.739 | 0.189 |
| Sparse | 0.917 | 0.797 | 0.183 |

Dense drops the most (-12% recall) — pure semantic search struggles when query phrasing diverges from source text. Sparse also drops, but hybrid is the most robust with the smallest decline (-4% recall), confirming that combining both signals provides resilience to query variation.

---

### Round 3 — Paraphrased + Multi-Doc Relevance (Final)

Binary relevance labels replaced with graded labels: all retrieved chunks judged relevant by GPT are counted as correct. This removes the unfair penalty for retrieving chunks that are genuinely relevant but weren't the single labelled document.

| Method | Recall@5 | MRR | Precision@5 |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| Dense  | 0.974 | 0.881 | 0.490 |
| Hybrid | 0.984 | 0.922 | 0.458 |
| Sparse | 0.946 | 0.879 | 0.344 |

All methods improve substantially once genuinely relevant chunks are no longer penalised. Dense recovers strongly on precision (0.49), reflecting its ability to retrieve semantically similar content that binary labels previously marked as wrong. Hybrid remains the best overall retriever with the highest MRR (0.922) and recall (0.984). Sparse falls behind on precision, retrieving the right document at rank 1 but filling remaining slots with less relevant results.

---

### Round 4 — Hybrid + CrossEncoder Reranking

A CrossEncoder reranker (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) was applied on top of hybrid retrieval, reranking the top 20 candidates down to 5.

| Method | Recall@5 | MRR | Precision@5 |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| Hybrid | 0.984 | 0.922 | 0.458 |
| Hybrid + CrossEncoder | 0.974 | 0.909 | 0.196 |

The reranker does not improve performance on this corpus. Precision drops significantly (0.458 → 0.196), indicating the CrossEncoder — trained on MS MARCO web search data — does not transfer well to the conversational style of Google I/O talk transcripts. Hybrid retrieval alone is the recommended production configuration.

---

### Round 5 — Agentic Retrieval (Query Rewriting + Hybrid)

An agentic retrieval layer was added on top of the existing hybrid retriever. The pipeline consists of three phases:

1. **Query rewriter** — GPT-4o-mini generates one retrieval-optimised variant of the user query, diversifying vocabulary to improve recall across both BM25 and dense retrieval
2. **Self-evaluator** — scores each retrieved chunk 1–5 for relevance; acts as a circuit breaker (scores ≤ 2 trigger strategy switching, not re-ranking)
3. **Retry loop** — if results fail the circuit breaker, falls back through `hybrid → dense → sparse`

This run used: `num_variants=1`, `top_k=5`, `use_self_eval=False` (query rewriting + hybrid only, no LLM scoring or retry), evaluated on the held-out **test set** (`data/eval/test/multi_doc.json`).

| Method | Recall@5 | MRR | Precision@5 |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| Hybrid (baseline) | 1.0000 | 0.9084 | 0.4513 |
| Agentic (rewrite + hybrid) | 1.0000 | 0.9066 | 0.4524 |

Recall is maintained at 1.0. MRR sees a marginal drop of −0.0018, while Precision improves slightly (+0.0011). The near-identical performance confirms that query rewriting does not degrade retrieval quality on this corpus — the rewritten variant occasionally shifts merge order by a small amount but leaves the overall result set essentially unchanged.

---

### Hyperparameter Optimisation (HPO)

Optuna was used to search over retrieve_k ∈ {20, 30, 50, 75, 100}, rerank_k ∈ {5, 10}, and two CrossEncoder models over 20 trials on a 50-query subsample. The best trial returned a value of ~0.0 (after cost penalty), confirming no meaningful gain from reranking on this dataset. HPO results are tracked in MLflow under the `hybrid_rerank_hpo` experiment.

---

### ✅ Final Production Configuration

**Hybrid retrieval, top_k=5, no reranker.**

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Recall@5 | 0.984 |
| MRR | 0.922 |
| Precision@5 | 0.458 |
